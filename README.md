# T680 Final Project 
# 3-D Segmentation of X-Ray Data Using U-net Model

1. Please open file: 'Last_Copy_of_3D_Segmentation_bita_composite_worked.ipynb'
2. Inout Image file is :'composite-bright.tif'
3. Mask file is: 'MASK_composite.tif'
4. Train the model with composite 256x256x256 Images 
5. Use trained model with Composite Large Images (512x512): 'new_composite-512x512x256.tif'
6. Save tiff file and segmented Images
