# Craps Game
##CS110 Final Project
Worked in a team of 4 to create a game of Craps. For this project, I coded RollingDie.py and Die.py, as well as a majority of CrapsStats.py. My main focus of the project was learning about GUI's and joining together the functions of each file to make the code and game run successfully.
